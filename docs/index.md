# Overview
The **ANASFV** project focuses on analyzing whole genome of African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV). It includes genome assembly, polishing, genome quality assessment, recombination detection, and phylogenetic analysis. It contains 4 available tasks:

- [mapping_assembly.py](assembly): Using nanopore reads of PCR-amplified ASFV to assemble a genome (This task is optional. If you have already obtained an assembled genome by other methods, you can apply Tasks 2, 3, and 4).

- [completeness.py](completeness): Assessing the quality of an assembled ASFV genome.

- [recombination_test.py](recombination): Checking for any evidence of recombination between genotypes I and II.

- [make_tree.py](tree): Constructing a phylogenetic tree using CDS.
