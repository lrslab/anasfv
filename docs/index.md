# Overview
The **ANASFV** project focuses on analyzing nanopore-sequenced data of PCR-amplified African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV). It contains 4 available tasks:

- [mapping_assembly.py](assembly): Using ONT reads of PCR-amplified ASFV to assemble a genome.

- [completeness.py](completeness): Analyzing the completeness of an assembled ASFV genome.

- [recombination_test.py](recombination): Checking for any evidence of recombination between genotypes I and II.

- [make_tree.py](tree): Constructing a phylogenetic tree.
