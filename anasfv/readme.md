## ANASFV
The **ANASFV** project focuses on analyzing nanopore-sequenced data of PCR-amplified African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV). It consists of 4 tasks:

Task 1: Using ONT reads of PCR-amplified ASFV to assemble a genome.

Task 2: Analyzing the completeness of the assembled ASFV genome.

Task 3: Checking for any evidence of recombination between genotypes I and II.

Task 4: Constructing a phylogenetic tree.
